# Multisensorial_Space

This project is for transforming the sense of our skin and our feeling of humidity into data. The visualization shows two dimensions of the humidity data. One is the humidity persetage, temperture, and dew point from the OpenWeather API. The other data correction is my body condition (Skin, eyes, subjectuve feeling) which I record everyday.
